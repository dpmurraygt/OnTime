    "#### Overview\n",
    "This dataset contains one month of flight(leg) level information for an airline.  This dataset was created with the intent to forecast ontime performance for an airline.  Ontime performance as defined by the US department of transportation as any flight arriving within 15 minutes of its scheduled arrival time in the destination city\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Origin** - The DOT airport code denoting the starting point of a flight leg (see link for list of codes:####)\n",
    "* **Destination** - The DOT airport code denoting the ending point of a flight leg.  This list contains the same values as the origin field as an origin can be a destination and a destination can be an origin.  All airlines serve markets in this fashion.  For example, if Delta Airlines serves ATL-MSY (Dallas-New Orleans), they also serve the market in the opposite direction: MSY-ATL. \n",
    "* **Market** - A market is any origin and destination pair.  For example: ATL-TPA is a market.  Airlines always serve markets in a balanced fashion.  This means that if the airline serves ATL-MSY 11 times a day, the airline also serves the MSY-ATL 11 times a day.  The airline can still arbitrage the capacity in directions which have imbalanced demand patterns via changes in aircraft size (gauge).  For instance, Delta may serve MSY-ATL with 11 regional jets and ATL-MSY with 11 Boeing 757s (considerably larger aircraft). However, most airlines use far more sophisticated methods.  Markets tend to have time of day seat (gauge) patterns that attempt to best match demand patterns.  This means that we expect to see markets with mixed gauge patterns throughout the day.\n",
    "* **Origin Latitude** - The latitude of the origin airport\n",
    "* **Origin Longitude** - The longitude of the origin airport\n",
    "* **Destination Latitude** - The latitude of the Destination airport\n",
    "* **Destination Longitude** - The longitude of the Destination airport\n",
    "* **Origin Country** - The country of origin for the flight leg.  Note that SJU (San Juan) is not included as international in this dataset per DOT specification.\n",
    "* **Origin Country** - The destination country for the flight leg.  Note that SJU (San Juan) is not included as international in this dataset per DOT specification.\n",
    "* **Flight Number** - Distinct number denoting a specific flight on a specific day.  While flight numbers can repeat on a day level, they cannot repeat at the same airport within 6 hours for obvious issues associated with the potential to have multiple flights in air with the same number at the same time from the same airline.  The number for scheduled flights ranges from 1-6999.  However, mistakes do happen, so it is best not to hard code filter any of these numbers.\n",
    "* **Miles Flown** - Great circle mileage calculation for miles flown.  Note that this does not vary by market as this is simply the scheduled mileage and does not take into account flight path diversions.\n",
    "* **Departure Date** - The date of departure between 5/1/2016 and 5/31/2016\n",
    "* **Day of Week** - The day of week that a flight departs with 1 being equivalent to Monday\n",
    "* **Flight Type Code** - One of 3 values indicating the flight type for DOT purposes.  This dataset was prefiltered to include only those types considered by the DOT for Ontime departures.\n",
    "    * **Blank Value**- Records that have no value for the flight type code were scheduled flights that flew as scheduled\n",
    "    * **Code S**- Records with flight type code S represent stub originator flights.  Stub originators are flights that were not scheduled to be originators on the flight line, but had an aircraft swap that made the route appear to have multiple orginator flights.  An originator is an aircraft's first flight of the day.  On average, aircraft in this dataset fly 6 flight legs per day.  A flight line could have both an originator and a stub originator with the given scenario.  Flight 1 on flight line number 150 from DAL-HOU departed HOU at 6am, and arrived in DAL at 7am.  The aircraft on flight route 150 was scheduled to continue on from HOU to ATL at 9am.  However, another flight line, say line 200, that was supposed to begin its day flying HOU-MCO at 8am had an aircraft go down for maintenance.  This line now has no aircraft to fly.  The dispatchers may decide that the aircraft on line 150 can take over line 200 and the aircraft on line 200 can take over line 150 because it leaves later and the maintenance issue can be fixed in time for the 9am HOU-ATL flight.  The flight that takes over line 150 is now considered a stub originator, flight type code 's.'  \n",
    "    * **Code X**- Flight type code X denotes a flight that was cancelled.  Due to the sparse nature of the attributes in this dataset, we will calculate OTP with \n",
    "* **Flight Route Number**: The route number denotes an aircraft's line of flying for the day.  These will repeat for a given aircraft for a day for all flights in the flight line.\n",
    "* **Route Sequence Number**: A number between 1 and 10 that denotes the aircraft's leg number on the flight line.\n",
    "* **Aircraft Type Code** : The type of aircraft flying the flight.  All aircraft in this dataset are Boeing 737 variants\n",
